Regions and Availability Zones
  Regions
  Availability Zones - nothing but data centers
  Edge Locations
  End points - ex: https://dynamodb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com

Some Terminology:
  Scalability: Ability to handle increased workload by expanding according to the load
  Fault Tolerance: Ability to continuously operate without interruption in the event of service failures
  Elasticity: Capability of infrastructure to scale up or down automatically.
  Durablity: Ability to stay strong and in a good condition over a long period of time
  Availablility: Continue to operate and provide the same services as it originally did
